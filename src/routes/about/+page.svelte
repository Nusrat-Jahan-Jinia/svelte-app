			The design of the Parliament Building, made by the famous architect Professor Louis I. Kahn,
			was evolved from the basic human requirement of protection from the glare and fury of nature.
			This has been achieved through the overall arrangement of the complex in different groups of
			buildings in which normal external lines are deeply recessed by porticoes with huge geometric
			openings on its outer facade, forming the visual characteristics of the building. Thus
			conventional methods of protecting external windows have been effectively substituted,
			resulting in the compositional effect of these huge openings, befitting the scale of the
			building. The use of exposed concrete walls to contrast the surrounding buildings with exposed
			brick exteriors, merges with the land and its culture. The lake on three sides of the main
			building, extending up to the Members hostel not only creates visual relief for the beholder
			but also echoes the riverine beauty of Bangladesh. The entire complex has a floor area of
			8,23,000 sq. ft. in the main building, 2,23,000 sq. ft. in the South Plaza and 65,000 sq. ft.
			in the Presidential Plaza.

			The Presidential Plaza to the north, serves as an intimate plaza for MPs and other
			dignitaries. It contains marble steps, a gallery and an open pavement. Its ground floor is
			partly open and partly occupied by stores. The Parliament Building itself consists of nine
			individual blocks of which, eight peripheral blocks rise to a height of 110' while the
			octagonal block rises to a height of 155'. All of these nine blocks surrounding the ambulatory
			contain different groups of functional spaces and have an interplay of different levels,
			inter-linked horizontally and vertically with corridors, lifts, stairs, light courts and
			circular areas. All have blended into a harmonious whole.

			The total seating capacity in the Parliament Chamber is 354 plus the podium and two V.I.P.
			galleries. The Chamber has a maximum height of 117' with a parabolic shell roof at its top.
			There is here a splendid feature: a clear story above the parabolic shell that lets in
			daylight, which reflects from the surrounding walls and octagonal drum filters into the
			Parliament Chamber, demonstrating the ability of Louis Khan to combine architecture with
			light. The artificial lighting system of the Parliament Chamber has been devised in such a
			manner that it does not obstruct the infiltration of daylight. A composite chandelier,
			consisting of a metallic web, supports the individual light fixtures and is itself suspended
			from the parabolic shell.

		<div class="pb-3 font-deca text-sm lg:text-xl font-normal text-black opacity-70">
			At the upper levels of this block are the visitors and press galleries as well as
			communication booths, which overlook the Parliament Chamber. Among others, it also contains at
			level one, a library, MPs lounges at level three, and Party rooms at the upper level. The main
			committee rooms are located in one of the peripheral blocks at level two. All parliamentary
			functionaries, including Ministers and chairpersons of some of the Standing Committees, have
			offices in this building, as does the Parliament Secretariat.
